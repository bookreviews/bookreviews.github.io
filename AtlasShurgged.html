        Ayn Rand's Atlas Shurgged is timeless novel depicting the greed and corruption of anit-capitalists. Through themes of sacrifice, morality and.... she inflicts upon the reade the sturggle and detterence felt by capitalising in a socialist society.
      <break>
        Ayn Rand's vision of capitalism is portrayed strongly thorghout her novel, however, it leaves little room for interpretation from the reader. Her stance is clear. Captialists are the heros, and the governmet, regylations, and socialists are the villains. 
  
      
    Part One: Non-contradiction: 
      <ul> 
        <li> nothing is contradictory, re-examine your perspecitve, one is wrong </li> 
        <li> Ayn Rand's view of sex and relationships, complete female submission and male dominance </li> 
        <li> The completeness of good and evil, capitlists and socialists, one is completely bad one is completely good, no room for gray area </li> 
        <li> Morphed sense of loyalty and respect to family and tradition </li>
        <li> The feminitiy and sexuality of the author arises in descriptions such as describing the atractivity of each charcater</li> 
        <li> Mystery around the sudden dissappearance of prominent businessmen </li>
        <li> The identity and significance of John Galt </li>
        
        
        
    </ul> 
    
    Part Two: Non-contradiction:
    <ul> 
      <li> theme: sacrifice; is it self scacrifice worth it for the good of the public? </li> 
      <li> quitting, giving in, do you want to stand behind a name that has been corrupted and is no longer what you stand for? Self scarifice would be continuing to play by the government's rules and demands </li> 
    <li> throw the idea of self sacrifice back in the government's face, refusing to give in to demands, but refusing to give up everything he worked for by dissapearing </li> 
    <li> only seeing the government as the bad guys, greedy and corrupt, capitalists are only good, hardworking businessmen </li> 
    
    </ul>
