    Part One: Non-contradiction: 
      <ul> 
        <li> nothing is contradictory, re-examine your perspecitve, one is wrong </li> 
        <li> Ayn Rand's view of sex and relationships, complete female submission and male dominance, yet still instilling a morphed sence of loyalty and tradition </li> 
        <li> The completeness of good and evil, capitlists and socialists, one is compeltely bad one is completely good, no room for gray area </li>
