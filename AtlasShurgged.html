 Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is a timeless novel depicting the greed and corruption of anti-capitalists. Through themes of ability, sacrifice, and morality, Rand inflicts upon the reader the struggle and deterrence felt by capitalists in a socialist society. 
Readers follow main character Dagney Taggart, a seemingly independent businesswoman who really is depicted as a slut for libertarians and anarchists. Throughout the novel she sleeps with nearly every main male character, who are all folds of the same man. Even Rand's depiction of sex is sexist, describing it in scenes of male domination and utter female submission. Although sexism was consistent with the time period, Rand seemed a little too willingly adamant about upholding some of its implementations. 
However weak the character development and plot is, the philosophy behind the novel is accurate and thought provoking. The novel follows increased laws and regulations on businesses, implemented by corrupt officials seemingly for the public good. But who determines what is good for the public? What must individuals sacrifice for the "good" of society why must individuals sacrifice for the good of society? Are our rights, beliefs and lives not being diminished and belittled by some of these commandments? Who can command morals? Who can command what is supposedly good? What makes individuality and self preservation evil? Beliefs are built on society's interests, but through this novel it is apparent how society's interests can not only be skewed or blatantly contradicting individual interests, but corrupted with misdirection by high power influencers and media. So what is evil? What is good? Why must I be miserable for my neighbor to be happy? These are the important questions tackled in the extensive pages of Atlas Shrugged. It all seems to contradict, but she says there is no such thing as a contradiction. Re Examine your perspective, one must be wrong. Picking sides, right or wrong, "is better than standing in the middle for the unsure, indecisive is evil". 
Ayn follows this gray area of indecisiveness herself with her depiction of the completeness of good and evil between socialists and capitalists. Every capitalist character is good, a beaten up hero who is trying to save himself and his country, whereas every socialist is a selfish corrupted evil destroying the economy, the country and lives. Ayn Rand's vision of capitalism is portrayed strongly throughout her novel, however, it leaves little room for interpretation from the reader. Her stance is clear. Capitalists are the heros, and the government, regulations, and socialists are the villains. Part One: Non-contradiction:

  Ayn Rand broke up her more than 1000 page book into three sections " Non-Contradiction, Either/Or, A is A" 
      
    Part One: Non-contradiction: 
      <ul> 
        <li> nothing is contradictory, re-examine your perspecitve, one is wrong </li> 
        <li> Ayn Rand's view of sex and relationships, complete female submission and male dominance </li> 
        <li> The completeness of good and evil, capitlists and socialists, one is completely bad one is completely good, no room for gray area </li> 
        <li> Morphed sense of loyalty and respect to family and tradition </li>
        <li> The feminitiy and sexuality of the author arises in descriptions such as describing the atractivity of each charcater</li> 
        <li> Mystery around the sudden dissappearance of prominent businessmen </li>
        <li> The identity and significance of John Galt </li>
        
        
        
    </ul> 
    
    Part Two: Either-Or:
    <ul> 
      <li> theme: sacrifice; is it self scacrifice worth it for the good of the public? </li> 
      <li> theme: ability; "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need" need versus ability </li>
      <li> quitting, giving in, do you want to stand behind a name that has been corrupted and is no longer what you stand for? Self scarifice would be continuing to play by the government's rules and demands </li> 
    <li> throw the idea of self sacrifice back in the government's face, refusing to give in to demands, but refusing to give up everything he worked for by dissapearing </li> 
    <li> only seeing the government as the bad guys, greedy and corrupt, capitalists are only good, hardworking businessmen </li> 
    
    </ul>
        
        Part Three: A is A: 
        
        <li>  a lot of questions are answered, the reader is given an understanding of the purpose of deserters,</li> 
        <li> themes of: ability- don't fear another man's ability, morality, </li>
