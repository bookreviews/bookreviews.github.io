        Ayn Rand's Atlas Shurgged is timeless novel depicting the greed and corruption of anit-capitalists. Through themes of ability, sacrifice, and morality, Rand inflicts upon the reader the sturggle and deterrence felt by capitalists in a socialist society.
      <break>
        Readers follow main character Dagney Taggart, a seemingly independent businesswoman who really is depicted as a slut for liberatarians and anarchists. Throughout the novel she sleeps with nearly every main male character, who are all folds of the same man. Even Rand's depiction of sex is sexist, describing it in scenes of male domination and utter female submission. Although sexism was consitent with the time period, Rand seemed a little too willingly adament about upholding some of its implementations. 
        <break> 
         However weak the character devlopment and plot is, the philospohy behind the novel is accurate and thought provoking. The novel follows increased lawgs and regulations on businesses, implemented by corrupt officals seemingly for the public good. But who determines what is good for the public? What must individuals sacrifice for the "good" of society <i> why </i> must individuals sacrifice for the good of society? Are our rights, beliefs and lives not being diminished and belittled by some of these commandments? 
          Who can command morals? Who can command what is supposedly good? What makes inviduality and self preservation evil? Beliefs are built on society's interests, but therough this novel it is apparent how society's interests can not only be scewed or blantanlty contradicting individual interests, but corrupted with misdirection by high power influecners and media. 
          <break> So what is evil? What is good? Why must I be miserable for my neighbor to be happy? These are the importatn quesions tackled in the extensive pages of Atlas Shrugged. It all seems to contradivting, but she says there is no such thing as a contradiction. Rexexamine your postions, one must be wrong. Picking sides, right or wrong, "is betetr than standing in the middle for the unsure, indecisive is evil". 
        Ayn Rand's vision of capitalism is portrayed strongly thorghout her novel, however, it leaves little room for interpretation from the reader. Her stance is clear. Captialists are the heros, and the governmet, regulations, and socialists are the villains.
