    Kelly goes over horrific accounts of torture, rape, and execution with a emotionless factual depiction. I can't tell if that makes these events even more horific to read about as they seem to be almost casually normaized, or if it takes away from the pain and horror they depict. 
    
    Lilac Girls follows the accounts of three different women during the World War II era. Caroline, a New York actress/socialite turned french embassy worker, Herta, a german doctor wanna be surgeon working at a concentraion camp, and Kasia, a catholic pole brought to a concentration camp in germany after trafficking undegraound infrmation and girl sagainst the nazis.
